#![no_std]

use ink_lang as ink;

#[ink::contract]
mod simple_ai {

    #[ink(storage)]
    pub struct SimpleAi {
        weights: [i32; 5], // Extremely simplified model weights
    }

    impl SimpleAi {
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn new(initial_weights: [i32; 5]) -> Self {
            Self {
                weights: initial_weights,
            }
        }

        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn predict(&self, input: [i32; 5]) -> i32 {
            // Extremely simplified linear model prediction
            let mut output = 0;
            for i in 0..5 {
                output += self.weights[i] * input[i];
            }
            output
        }
    }

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract BasicAIAgent {

    address public owner;
    string public agentName;
    string public agentStatus;

    constructor(string memory _agentName) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        agentName = _agentName;
        agentStatus = "Initialized";
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function.");
        _;
    }

    function updateStatus(string memory _newStatus) public onlyOwner {
        agentStatus = _newStatus;

Rust for Smart Contracts:
    - (Assume) Used with a framework like ink! for building smart contracts on Substrate-based chains (which Nexis Network might be).
    - Benefits: Memory safety, performance.
    - Challenges: Steeper learning curve compared to Solidity.

Solidity for Smart Contracts:
    - Most widely used language for EVM-compatible blockchains.
    - Large community, extensive tooling.
    - Easier to learn than Rust for many developers.

LLMs and SLMs:
    - LLMs (Large Language Models): Trained on massive datasets, capable of complex language tasks (e.g., GPT-3).
    - SLMs (Small Language Models): More specialized, efficient for specific tasks.
    - Blockchain can provide decentralized infrastructure for training and deploying these models.

Mintlify:
    - .mdx format allows for rich, interactive documentation.
    - `mint.json` configures navigation and site structure.

**Actionable First Steps (Next Actions)**

1.  **Subsections:** I will finalize the subsections for the "AI Agents" section within the <Notepad>, ensuring a logical flow and covering all essential topics. This will build on the draft in Phase 1, Task 1.
2.  **Smart Contract Outlines:** I will create more detailed outlines for each of the four smart contract examples (two Solidity, two Rust) in the <Notepad>. This will involve defining the specific functionality, inputs, outputs, and key methods for each contract.
3.  **Keyword Refinement:**  I will review and refine the keyword list in the <Notepad>, ensuring it covers all relevant terms for this specific documentation section, focusing on the intersection of AI and blockchain, as well as the specific keywords provided in the original prompt.
4.  **`mint.json` Structure:** I will draft the complete `mint.json` structure, including the new "AI Agents" section and its nested pages, in the <Notepad>.

I will now execute these "Actionable First Steps" and update the <Notepad> accordingly. This detailed planning and organization will ensure the documentation is comprehensive, well-structured, and effectively addresses the prompt's requirements.
