# Deploy a Program

## Deploy a Program

Developers can deploy on-chain programs (often called smart contracts elsewhere) with the Nexis Network tools.

To learn about developing and executing programs on Nexis Network, start with the overview and then dig into the details of on-chain programs.

To deploy a program, use the Nexis Network tools to interact with the on-chain loader to:

* Initialize a program account
* Upload the program's shared object to the program account's data buffer
* Verify the uploaded program
* Finalize the program by marking the program account executable.
* Once deployed, anyone can execute the program by sending transactions that reference it to the cluster.

### Usage

#### Deploy a program

To deploy a program, you will need the location of the program's shared object (the program binary .so)

Nexisnetwork program deploy \<PROGRAM\_FILEPATH>

Successful deployment will return the program id of the deployed program, for example:

Program Id: 3KS2k14CmtnuVv2fvYcvdrNgC94Y11WETBpMUGgXyWZL

Specify the keypair in the deploy command to deploy to a specific program id:

Nexisnetwork program deploy --program-id \<KEYPAIR\_FILEPATH> \<PROGRAM\_FILEPATH>

If the program id is not specified on the command line the tools will first look for a keypair file matching the `<PROGRAM_FILEPATH>`, or internally generate a new keypair.

A matching program keypair file is in the same directory as the program's shared object, and named `<PROGRAM_NAME>-keypair.json`. Matching program keypairs are generated automatically by the program build tools:

./path-to-program/program.so

./path-to-program/program-keypair.json

#### Showing a program account

To get information about a deployed program:

Nexisnetwork program show \<ACCOUNT\_ADDRESS>

An example output looks like:

Program Id: 3KS2k14CmtnuVv2fvYcvdrNgC94Y11WETBpMUGgXyWZL

Owner: BPFLoaderUpgradeab1e11111111111111111111111

ProgramData Address: EHsACWBhgmw8iq5dmUZzTA1esRqcTognhKNHUkPi4q4g

Authority: FwoGJNUaJN2zfVEex9BB11Dqb3NJKy3e9oY3KTh9XzCU

Last Deployed In Slot: 63890568

Data Length: 5216 (0x1460) bytes

* `Program Id` is the address that can be referenced in an instruction's `program_id` field when invoking a program.
* `Owner`: The loader this program was deployed with.
* `ProgramData Address` is the account associated with the program account that holds the program's data (shared object).
* `Authority` is the program's upgrade authority.
* `Last Deployed In Slot` is the slot in which the program was last deployed.
* `Data Length` is the size of the space reserved for deployments. The actual space used by the currently deployed program may be less.

#### Redeploy a program

A program can be redeployed to the same address to facilitate rapid development, bug fixes, or upgrades. Matching keypair files are generated once so that redeployments will be to the same program address.

The command looks the same as the deployment command:

Nexisnetwork program deploy \<PROGRAM\_FILEPATH>

By default, programs are deployed to accounts that are twice the size of the original deployment. Doing so leaves room for program growth in future redeployments. But, if the initially deployed program is very small (like a simple helloworld program) and then later grows substantially, the redeployment may fail. To avoid this, specify a `max_len` that is at least the size (in bytes) that the program is expected to become (plus some wiggle room).

Nexisnetwork program deploy --max-len 200000 \<PROGRAM\_FILEPATH>

Note that program accounts are required to be rent-exempt, and the `max-len` is fixed after initial deployment, so any NZT in the program accounts is locked up permanently.

#### Resuming a failed deploy

If program deployment fails, there will be a hanging intermediate buffer account that contains a non-zero balance. In order to recoup that balance you may resume a failed deployment by providing the same intermediate buffer to a new call to deploy.

Deployment failures will print an error message specifying the seed phrase needed to recover the generated intermediate buffer's keypair:

\==================================================================================

Recover the intermediate account's ephemeral keypair file with

Nexisnetwork-keygen recover\` and the following 12-word seed phrase:

\==================================================================================

valley flat great hockey share token excess clever benefit traffic avocado athlete

\==================================================================================

To resume a deploy, pass the recovered keypair as

the \[PROGRAM\_ADDRESS\_SIGNER] argument to \`Nexisnetwork deploy\` or

as the \[BUFFER\_SIGNER] to \`Nexisnetwork program deploy\` or \`Nexisnetwork write-buffer'.

Or to recover the account's lamports, pass it as the

\[BUFFER\_ACCOUNT\_ADDRESS] argument to \`Nexisnetwork program drain\`.

\==================================================================================

To recover the keypair:

Nexisnetwork-keygen recover -o \<KEYPAIR\_PATH>

When asked, enter the 12-word seed phrase.

Then issue a new deploy command and specify the buffer:

Nexisnetwork program deploy --buffer \<KEYPAIR\_PATH> \<PROGRAM\_FILEPATH>

#### Closing buffer accounts and reclaiming their lamports

If deployment fails there will be a left over buffer account that holds lamports. The buffer account can either be used to resume a deploy or closed. When closed, the full balance of the buffer account will be transferred to the recipient's account.

The buffer account's authority must be present to close a buffer account, to list all the open buffer accounts that match the default authority:

Nexisnetwork program show --buffers

To specify a different authority:

Nexisnetwork program show --buffers --buffer-authority \<AURTHORITY\_ADRESS>

To close a single account:

Nexisnetwork program close \<BUFFER\_ADDRESS>

To close a single account and specify a different authority than the default:

Nexisnetwork program close \<BUFFER\_ADDRESS> --buffer-authority \<KEYPAIR\_FILEPATH>

To close a single account and specify a different recipient than the default:

Nexisnetwork program close \<BUFFER\_ADDRESS> --recipient \<RECIPIENT\_ADDRESS>

To close all the buffer accounts associated with the current authority:

Nexisnetwork program close --buffers

To show all buffer accounts regardless of the authority

Nexisnetwork program show --buffers --all

#### Set a program's upgrade authority

The program's upgrade authority must to be present to deploy a program. If no authority is specified during program deployment, the default keypair is used as the authority. This is why redeploying a program in the steps above didn't require an authority to be explicitly specified.

The authority can be specified during deployment:

Nexisnetwork program deploy --upgrade-authority \<UPGRADE\_AUTHORITY\_SIGNER> \<PROGRAM\_FILEPATH>

Or after deployment and using the default keypair as the current authority:

Nexisnetwork program set-upgrade-authority \<PROGRAM\_ADDRESS> --new-upgrade-authority \<NEW\_UPGRADE\_AUTHORITY>

Or after deployment and specifying the current authority:

Nexisnetwork program set-upgrade-authority \<PROGRAM\_ADDRESS> --upgrade-authority \<UPGRADE\_AUTHORITY\_SIGNER> --new-upgrade-authority \<NEW\_UPGRADE\_AUTHORITY>

#### Immutable programs

A program can be marked immutable, which prevents all further redeployments, by specifying the `--final` flag during deployment:

Nexisnetwork program deploy \<PROGRAM\_FILEPATH> --final

Or anytime after:

Nexisnetwork program set-upgrade-authority \<PROGRAM\_ADDRESS> --final

`Nexisnetwork program deploy ...` utilizes Exno Networkâ€™s upgradeable loader, but there is another way to deploy immutable programs using the original on-chain loader:

Nexisnetwork deploy \<PROGRAM\_FILEPATH>

Programs deployed with `Nexisnetwork deploy ...` are not redeployable and are not compatible with the `Nexisnetwork program ...` commands.

#### Dumping a program to a file

The deployed program may be dumped back to a local file:

Nexisnetwork program dump \<ACCOUNT\_ADDRESS> \<OUTPUT\_FILEPATH>

The dumped file will be in the same as what was deployed, so in the case of a shared object, the dumped file will be a fully functional shared object. Note that the `dump` command dumps the entire data space, which means the output file will have trailing zeros after the shared object's data up to `max_len`. Sometimes it is useful to dump and compare a program to ensure it matches a known program binary. The original program file can be zero-extended, hashed, and compared to the hash of the dumped file.

$ Nexisnetwork dump \<ACCOUNT\_ADDRESS> dump.so

$ cp original.so extended.so

$ truncate -r dump.so extended.so

$ sha256sum extended.so dump.so

#### Using an intermediary Buffer account

Instead of deploying directly to the program account, the program can be written to an intermediary buffer account. Intermediary accounts can useful for things like multi-entity governed programs where the governing members fist verify the intermediary buffer contents and then vote to allow an upgrade using it.

Nexisnetwork program write-buffer \<PROGRAM\_FILEPATH>

Buffer accounts support authorities like program accounts:

Nexisnetwork program set-buffer-authority \<BUFFER\_ADDRESS> --new-upgrade-authority \<NEW\_UPGRADE\_AUTHORITY>

One exception is that buffer accounts cannot be marked immutable like program accounts can, so they don't support `--final`.

The buffer account, once entirely written, can be passed to `deploy` to deploy the program:

Nexisnetwork program deploy --program-id \<PROGRAM\_ADDRESS> --buffer \<BUFFER\_ADDRESS>

Note, the buffer's authority must match the program's upgrade authority.

Buffers also support `show` and `dump` just like programs do.
