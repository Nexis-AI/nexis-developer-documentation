# Command-line Guide

**Command-line Guide**

In this section, we will describe how to use the Nexis Network command-line tools to create a _wallet_, to send and receive NZT tokens, and to participate in the cluster by delegating stake.

To interact with a Nexis Network cluster, we will use its command-line interface, also known as the CLI. We use the command-line because it is the first place the Nexis Network core team deploys new functionality. The command-line interface is not necessarily the easiest to use, but it provides the most direct, flexible, and secure access to your Nexis Network accounts.

**Getting Started**

To get started using the Nexis Command Line (CLI) tools:

* Install the Nexis Network Tools
* Choose a Cluster
* Create a Wallet
* Check out our CLI conventions
