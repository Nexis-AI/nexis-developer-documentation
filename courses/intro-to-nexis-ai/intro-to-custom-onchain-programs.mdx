## Summary

Nexis Native Chain has multiple onchain programs you can use. Instructions that use these
programs have data in a custom format determined by the specific function being
invoked in the onchain program.

## Lesson

### Instructions

In previous chapters, we used:

- The `SystemProgram.transfer()` function from `@nexis-network/web3.js` to make an
  instruction for the System program to transfer NZT.
- The `mintTo()` and `transfer()` functions from `@nexis-network/spl-token`, to make
  instructions to the Token program to mint and transfer tokens
- The `createCreateMetadataAccountV3Instruction()` function from
  `@metaplex-foundation/mpl-token-metadata@2` to make instructions to Metaplex
  to create token Metadata.

When working with other programs, however, you’ll need to create instructions
manually. With `@nexis-network/web3.js`, you can create instructions with the
`TransactionInstruction` constructor:

```typescript
const instruction = new TransactionInstruction({
  programId: PublicKey;
  keys: [
    {
      pubkey: Pubkey,
      isSigner: boolean,
      isWritable: boolean,
    },
  ],
  data?: Buffer;
});
```

`TransactionInstruction()` takes 3 fields:

- The `programId` field is fairly self-explanatory: it’s the public key (also
  called the 'address' or 'program ID') of the program.

- `keys` is an array of accounts and how they will be used during the
  transaction. You need to know the behavior of the program you are calling and
  ensure that you provide all of the necessary accounts in the array.

  - `pubkey` - the public key of the account
  - `isSigner` - a boolean representing whether or not the account is a signer
    on the transaction
  - `isWritable` - a boolean representing whether or not the account is written
    to during the transaction's execution

- an optional `Buffer` containing data to pass to the program. We’ll be ignoring
  the `data` field for now, but we will revisit it in a future lesson.

After making our instruction, we add it to a transaction, send the tramsaction
to our RPC to be processed and confirmed, then look at the transaction
signature.

```typescript
const transaction = new web3.Transaction().add(instruction);

const signature = await web3.sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  connection,
  transaction,
  [payer],
);

console.log(`✅ Success! Transaction signature is: ${signature}`);
```

All transactions on the blockchain are publicly viewable on
[Nexis Native Chain Explorer](http://explorer.nexis.network). For example, you could take the
signature returned by `sendAndConfirmTransaction()` in the example above, search
for that signature in Nexis Native Chain Explorer, then see:

- when it occurred
- which block it was included in
- the transaction fee
- and more!

## Lab

### Writing transactions for the ping counter program

We’re going to create a script to ping an onchain program that increments a
counter each time it has been pinged. This program exists on the Nexis Native Chain Devnet
at address `ChT1B39WKLS8qUrkLvFDXMhEJ4F1XZzwUNHUt4AU9aVa`. The program stores
its data in a specific account at the address
`Ah9K7dQ8EHaZqcAsgBW8w37yN2eAy3koFmUn4x3CJtod`.

<div class="p-2 not-prose relative bg-gray-50/50 rounded-2xl overflow-hidden dark:bg-gray-800/25">
<div class="absolute inset-0 bg-grid-neutral-200/20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(0deg,#fff,rgba(255,255,255,0.6))] dark:bg-grid-white/5 dark:[mask-image:linear-gradient(0deg,rgba(255,255,255,0.1),rgba(255,255,255,0.5))]" style="background-position: 10px 10px;"></div>

</div>

### Basic scaffolding

We'll start by using the same packages and `.env` file we made earlier in
[Intro to Writing Data](/content/courses/intro-to-nexis-ai/intro-to-writing-data).

Name the file `send-ping-transaction.ts`:

```typescript
import * as web3 from "@nexis-network/web3.js";
import "dotenv/config";
import {
  getKeypairFromEnvironment,
  airdropIfRequired,
} from "@nexis-network-developers/helpers";

const payer = getKeypairFromEnvironment("SECRET_KEY");
const connection = new web3.Connection(web3.clusterApiUrl("devnet"));

const newBalance = await airdropIfRequired(
  connection,
  payer.publicKey,
  1 * web3.LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
  0.5 * web3.LAMPORTS_PER_SOL,
);
```

This will connect to Nexis Native Chain Devnet and request some test Lamports if needed.

### Ping program

Now let's talk to the Ping program! To do this, we need to:

1. create a transaction
2. create an instruction
3. add the instruction to the transaction
4. send the transaction

Remember, the most challenging piece here is including the right information in
the instructions. We know the address of the program that we are calling. We
also know that the program writes data to a separate account whose address we
also have. Let’s add the string versions of both of those as constants at the
top of the file:

```typescript
const PING_PROGRAM_ADDRESS = new web3.PublicKey(
  "ChT1B39WKLS8qUrkLvFDXMhEJ4F1XZzwUNHUt4AU9aVa",
);
const PING_PROGRAM_DATA_ADDRESS = new web3.PublicKey(
  "Ah9K7dQ8EHaZqcAsgBW8w37yN2eAy3koFmUn4x3CJtod",
);
```

Now let’s create a new transaction, then initialize a `PublicKey` for the
program account, and another for the data account.

```typescript
const transaction = new web3.Transaction();
const programId = new web3.PublicKey(PING_PROGRAM_ADDRESS);
const pingProgramDataId = new web3.PublicKey(PING_PROGRAM_DATA_ADDRESS);
```

Next, let’s create the instruction. Remember, the instruction needs to include
the public key for the Ping program and it also needs to include an array with
all the accounts that will be read from or written to. In this example program,
only the data account referenced above is needed.

```typescript
const transaction = new web3.Transaction();
const programId = new web3.PublicKey(PING_PROGRAM_ADDRESS);
const pingProgramDataId = new web3.PublicKey(PING_PROGRAM_DATA_ADDRESS);

const instruction = new web3.TransactionInstruction({
  keys: [
    {
      pubkey: pingProgramDataId,
      isSigner: false,
      isWritable: true,
    },
  ],
  programId,
});
```

Next, let’s add this instruction to the transaction we created. Then, call
`sendAndConfirmTransaction()` by passing in the connection, transaction, and
payer. Finally, let’s log the result of that function call so we can look it up
on Nexis Native Chain Explorer.

```typescript
transaction.add(instruction);

const signature = await web3.sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  connection,
  transaction,
  [payer],
);

console.log(`✅ Transaction completed! Signature is ${signature}`);
```

### Run the ping client and check Nexis Native Chain Explorer

Now run the code with the following command:

```bash
npx esrun send-ping-transaction.ts
```

It may take a moment or two but you should see a long string printed to the
console, like the following:

```
✅ Transaction completed! Signature is 55S47uwMJprFMLhRSewkoUuzUs5V6BpNfRx21MpngRUQG3AswCzCSxvQmS3WEPWDJM7bhHm3bYBrqRshj672cUSG
```

Copy the transaction signature. Then visit
[Nexis Native Chain explorer on devnet](https://explorer.nexis.network/?cluster=devnet). Paste
the signature into the search bar at the top of Nexis Native Chain Explorer (make sure
you're connected to Devnet) and hit enter. You should see all the details about
the transaction. If you scroll all the way to the bottom, then you will see
`Program Logs`, which show how many times the program has been pinged including
your ping.

<div class="p-2 not-prose relative bg-gray-50/50 rounded-2xl overflow-hidden dark:bg-gray-800/25">
<div class="absolute inset-0 bg-grid-neutral-200/20 [mask-image:linear-gradient(0deg,#fff,rgba(255,255,255,0.6))] dark:bg-grid-white/5 dark:[mask-image:linear-gradient(0deg,rgba(255,255,255,0.1),rgba(255,255,255,0.5))]" style="background-position: 10px 10px;"></div>
![Nexis Native Chain Explorer with logs from calling the Ping program](/public/assets/courses/unboxed/nexis-explorer-ping-result.png)
</div>

Scroll around the explorer and look at what you're seeing:

- The **Account Input(s)** will include:
  - The address of your payer - being debited 5000 lamports for the transaction
  - The program address for the ping program
  - The data address for the ping program
- The **Instruction** section will contain a single instruction with no data -
  the ping program is a pretty simple program, so it doesn't need any data.
- The **Program Instruction Logs** show the logs from the ping program.

If you want to make it easier to look at Nexis Native Chain Explorer for transactions in the
future, simply change your `console.log` to the following:

```typescript
console.log(
  `You can view your transaction on Nexis Native Chain Explorer at:\nhttps://explorer.nexis.network/tx/${signature}?cluster=devnet`,
);
```

And just like that you’re calling programs on the Nexis Native Chain network and writing
data onchain!

In the next few lessons, you’ll learn how to

1. Send transactions safely from the browser instead of running a script
2. Add custom data to your instructions
3. Deserialize data from the chain

## Challenge

Go ahead and create a script from scratch that will allow you to transfer NZT
from one account to another on Devnet. Be sure to print out the transaction
signature so you can look at it on Nexis Native Chain Explorer.
